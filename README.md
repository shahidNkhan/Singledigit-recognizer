# Singledigit-recognizer
Using neural networks to learn to recognize any digit
By changing the value, we can train it to learn to recognize any digit from 0-9. Uses neural networks with one hidden layer. The activation functions used are ReLU and sigmoid for the output layer. Accuracy is currently 97.8%.
The type of file used in the code is .csv.
